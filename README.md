## Reflection

### 1. Key difference:

Relational databases like MySQL have a fixed structure (schema) which means that every piece of data must fit into a set format, like rows and columns in a table.
Non-relational databases like MongoDB have a flexible structure, so the data doesn’t need to follow one strict format. This makes it easier to store different kinds of information that don’t always look the same.

### 2. Healthcare scenario:

At a cancer center, MongoDB could be used to store clinical trial information for patients, such as treatment plans, side effects, lab results, and follow-up notes. Each trial may collect different types of data, and not all patients have the same results. MongoDB’s flexible structure allows the center to organize and update this diverse information easily, helping researchers analyze outcomes without being limited by a fixed database format.
